Kitten Invaders
- an arcade shooter game inspired by Space Invaders by Taito.

Kittens are invading your planet! Shoot burgers and potatoes at them to thwart their attack!

If the kittens manage to land on your planet, they will eat all your food and destroy all your furniture, and it will be game over for you.
Avoid this at all cost!

Look out for falling hairballs and kitty toys, as these will damage and ultimately distroy you.

Good luck, and good gaming!
